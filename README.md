## 📌 Project Objective

Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) went public in May 2019 at \$45 and has since navigated a global pandemic, a ride-share collapse, and a macro rate-shock cycle. This project uses the full post-IPO price history (May 2019 – February 2025) to answer one central question:

> **Can we model and forecast how *risky* Uber stock is likely to be on any given future trading day — and how did that risk evolve over time?**

This matters to:
- **Options traders** pricing contracts on UBER's future volatility
- **Portfolio managers** sizing positions dynamically
- **Risk managers** computing time-varying Value-at-Risk for regulatory capital

The project is structured as a **modular, reusable Python package** (`src/uber_stock/`) with a single-command pipeline entry point, reproducible outputs, and a fully annotated analysis notebook — designed for professional portfolio presentation.

## 🛠️ Implementations Carried Out

### 1. Data Engineering & Cleaning (`data_loader.py`)
- Loaded raw Yahoo Finance CSV with **DD-MM-YYYY date format** — correctly parsed using `format="%d-%m-%Y"` to prevent pandas from silently scrambling dates and producing corrupted returns
- Enforced strict data quality: column standardisation, coercion to numeric, deduplication, positive-price/volume filter
- Dropped pre-IPO rows (guard against phantom rows before 2019-05-10 that would generate a +∞ return on day 1)
- Applied calendar-gap detection to warn of missing data without forward-filling (preserving statistical integrity)

### 2. Feature Engineering (`features.py`)
- **Log-returns** `ln(P_t / P_{t-1})` — decimal and ×100 (pct) forms
- **Annualised rolling volatility** at 21-day (1-month) and 63-day (1-quarter) windows with explicit `min_periods` to document NaN behaviour
- **Cumulative return**, rolling peak, and **drawdown series**
- **Lagged return features** (lag-1, lag-2, lag-5) for regression modelling
- **Volume log-change** as a liquidity proxy
- Calendar features: year, month, quarter, weekday

### 3. Statistical Diagnostics (`diagnostics.py`)
Four formal hypothesis tests run on the full return series:

| Test | H₀ | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Jarque-Bera** | Returns are Normally distributed | Reject — fat tails confirmed |
| **Augmented Dickey-Fuller** | Unit root present (non-stationary) | Reject — returns are stationary |
| **Ljung-Box** (lags 10, 20) | No autocorrelation in returns | Mostly fail to reject |
| **ARCH LM** | Constant conditional variance | Strongly reject — ARCH effects present |

### 4. Risk Metrics (`diagnostics.py`)
- **CAGR** computed via exact calendar days (not assumed 252 trading days/year)
- **Annualised volatility** = `std(log_return) × √252`
- **Sharpe Ratio** with configurable risk-free rate
- **Value at Risk (VaR 95%)** — 5th percentile of daily simple returns (decimal form)
- **Conditional VaR (CVaR 95%)** — mean of all days worse than the VaR threshold
- **Maximum Drawdown** from peak cumulative return

### 5. GARCH(1,1) Volatility Model (`models.py`)
- Fit a **GARCH(1,1)-AR(1) model with Student-t innovations** using the `arch` library
- Input: log-returns scaled to percentage form (`×100`) for numerical stability
- **COVID-crash winsorisation** at ±4σ before training — prevents the 4–6 extreme March 2020 daily returns from driving the optimizer to an IGARCH boundary (α+β = 1) and infinite-variance Student-t (ν < 3)
- **80/20 chronological train/test split** — no data leakage
- **Rolling 1-step-ahead OOS forecast** on the held-out 20% test set
- **5-day-ahead forward forecast** from the most recent market state
- Full parameter extraction: ω, α, β, ν, persistence, unconditional long-run volatility

### 6. Visualisations (`plots.py`)
- Adjusted close price series with key event annotations
- Daily log-return histogram vs. Normal distribution overlay
- Q-Q plot vs. Normal quantiles
- 21-day and 63-day rolling annualised volatility
- Drawdown curve (fill-between)
- GARCH in-sample conditional volatility vs. realised absolute returns
- OOS predicted vs. realised volatility (test period)
- 5-day-ahead forward volatility forecast with uncertainty shading

### 7. End-to-End Pipeline (`pipeline.py` + `scripts/run_pipeline.py`)
- Single-command execution: `python scripts/run_pipeline.py`
- Automatically creates all output directories
- Persists: 5 figures, 3 CSV tables, 2 JSON/text metric files
- Returns a summary row CSV for README badge-style reporting

## 📊 Results Obtained

All numbers below are from the validated pipeline run on **1,444 trading days (2019-05-10 → 2025-02-05)**.

### Risk & Return Summary

|---|---|---|
| **CAGR (Annualised Return)** | **+7.9%** | Moderate growth over 5.75 years from IPO price ~\$41.57 |
| **Annualised Volatility** | **52.7%** | High — consistent with a high-beta mobility/tech stock |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **0.41** | Below S&P 500 (~0.60 same period) — UBER compensated investors less per unit of risk |

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### 1. Log-Returns Are Essential for Rigorous Financial Analysis
Raw price levels are non-stationary (they drift and have non-constant variance). Log-returns are approximately stationary, additive over time, and symmetric — the correct input for ADF tests, GARCH models, and risk metrics. Using percentage-scaled log-returns (×100) for GARCH specifically ensures numerical stability during maximum-likelihood optimisation.

### 2. Volatility Is Not Constant — and It Clusters
The ARCH LM test (p ≈ 2.8 × 10⁻⁴⁶) provides overwhelming statistical evidence that UBER's daily return variance is time-varying. The GARCH persistence parameter (α+β = 0.955) quantifies that once volatility spikes — as in the COVID crash — it persists for approximately 15 trading days before decaying back toward its long-run average of 52.5%. A constant-variance model would be fundamentally wrong for risk forecasting.

### 3. Extreme Events Demand Fat-Tailed Distributions
The excess kurtosis of 10.17 and Student-t degrees of freedom ν = 8.0 confirm that UBER returns have significantly heavier tails than a Normal distribution. A Normal GARCH model would underestimate the probability of large daily moves by several orders of magnitude — directly impacting options pricing, VaR calculations, and margin requirements.

### 4. The Market Is Efficient for Return Prediction, Not Volatility Prediction
The AR(1) mean model coefficient (0.0138, p = 0.652) confirms that past returns have **no statistically significant predictive power** for the next day's return — consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis for a liquid NYSE stock. However, past *variance* (β = 0.856, p < 0.001) is a strong predictor of future variance. You cannot predict *where* a stock will go, but you can predict *how wildly* it will move.

### 5. Data Quality Is the Foundation of Every Model
The single most impactful fix in this project was correctly parsing the CSV date format (`DD-MM-YYYY` → `"%d-%m-%Y"`). Using `format="mixed"` caused pandas to misread ambiguous dates, scrambling the chronological order of prices. This produced corrupted log-returns with `std = 0.132` instead of `0.033`, making annualised volatility appear as **212%** instead of the correct **52.7%**, and GARCH parameters collapse to the degenerate IGARCH boundary. A single incorrect assumption at ingestion invalidated every downstream output.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- `arch` library: `pip install arch`

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheerajc15/uber-stock-prices.git
cd uber-stock-prices
pip install -e .
# or for exact environment reproduction:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Full Pipeline
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```
This executes all steps end-to-end: data loading → feature engineering → diagnostics → GARCH modelling → visualisations → metrics export.

### Open the Analysis Notebook
```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/report.ipynb
```
The notebook requires the pipeline to be run first (to generate `outputs/`), or run `Cell 1` which calls `run_full_analysis()` automatically.
